# Movies-ETL
In this module we performed the ETL which is Extract, Transform and Load.
Initially, we collected the data from different resources in the form of cvs and Json files.  To clean the data, we used functions like regular expression, lambda function.  Lastly, we merged are datasets and load these into the database.
